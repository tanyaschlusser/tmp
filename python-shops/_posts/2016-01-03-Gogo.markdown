Tech is growing in Chicago, as witnessed by Gogo's hip new downtown headquarters.
Gogo Inc. moved downtown from Itasca, Illinois last year, and occupies the
top four floors of the newly renovated office right next to the train station
at 111 N. Canal. 
The largest downtown move in 2015, it injected 500 more tech professionals
into the Chicago scene. And lucky for ChiPy, they are eager grow technology
in Chicago by hosting events like ours.


## Wifi in your airplane

Gogo provides in-flight broadband internet service and other
connectivity services, and have been publicly traded since 2013.
Their first technology, Air-To-Ground, was literally conceived on the
back of a napkin after a nice steak dinner in Texas in 1991.
Our favorite part of their headquarters is their test cabin, an
electrostatically shielded room that simulates the inflight wireless
experience.

The fearless leader of our mentor program, "T" (Tathagata) Dasgupta
approves:

## Why Chicago?

&lt;&lt; Need help from Jodie / Tyler &gt;&gt;


## Python programming in the devops team

Gogo's primary language is Java, but they're a polyglot shop, and
Python is growing increasingly popular in devops. In Chicago,
our [Python user group survey][survey-Q42015]
shows approximately equal interest in devops, web development,
and data science, with the highest growth in Devops.

### Why Python and not Ruby? Especially if they're using Chef?

### What else do they use?

### Do you see any local talent gaps?

### What open source projects do you like?
