# Gogo’s devops team talks Python and Chicago's growing tech scene

ChiPy's January 2016 meetup was held at our newest [platinum
sponsor]() Gogo's headquarters. Their move downtown from Itasca, Illinois last
year is more proof that tech is growing in Chicago.
Gogo Inc. occupies the
top four floors of the newly renovated office right next to Union station.
The largest downtown move in 2015, it injected 500 more tech professionals
into the Chicago scene. And lucky for ChiPy, they are eager grow technology
in Chicago by hosting events like ours.


## Wifi in your airplane

Gogo provides in-flight broadband internet service and other
connectivity services, and have been publicly traded since 2013.
Their first technology, Air-To-Ground, was literally conceived on the
back of a napkin after a nice steak dinner in Texas in 1991.
Our favorite part of their headquarters is their test cabin, an
electrostatically shielded room that simulates the inflight wireless
experience.

The fearless leader of our mentor program, "T" (Tathagata) Dasgupta
approves:

The Gogo's devops team describes itself as diverse, fast-paced, and fun.
Gogo's primary language is Java, but they're a polyglot shop, and
Python is growing increasingly popular in devops. In Chicago,
our [Python user group survey][survey-Q42015]
shows approximately equal interest in devops, web development,
and data science, with the highest growth in Devops.

We asked a few questions for curious Chicago Pythonistas:


### What is DevOps using Python for? Why not Ruby? I'm surprised DevOps is so big in the Python community.

We love Python. Seriously. I don't think that we use it because we're DevOps, but rather we come from an operations and development backgrounds where Python is - without exception - our language of choice. What's that Ruby thing of which you speak? We used to be a Puppet shop, but we recently made the switch to Ansible to help bootstrap our servers in AWS.


### Favorite packages

* [Ansible's Python API](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_api.html) — wishing they would upgrade to Python 3...
* [Boto3](https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) — the AWS SDK for Python
* [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) — Composed CLIs; Argparse for multi-layered projects
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) Who doesn't love it?

### Where do you see Chicago's tech scene going in 2016 and beyond?

The biggest worry in my mind is that there's a growing skills shortage in the Chicago area, and whereas supply-and-demand may cause salary hikes, it's going to hamstring companies and limit everyone's ability to grow. With that being said, we feel it is important for the City of Chicago to invest in tech hubs and educational programs around technology (including our schools). Some of our employees today volunteer to help with [Hour of Code](http://www.code.org) (a program for people around the world to spend one hour to learn to code) and we are always looking for new ways to help out the community in any way we can (both with and without technology).


### What open source projects do you like?

We're already involved in a handful of open source projects like [Errbot](http://errbot.io/) and [Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project/). We have some fun on-the-side personal projects in GitHub like [Rop](https://github.com/ak15199/rop) for driving LED arrays, and we have our own in-house project (pyasgard) for glue between Jenkins and Netflix Asgard that we'd like to open source when we're happy with it.
