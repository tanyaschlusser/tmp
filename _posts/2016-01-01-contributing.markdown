Welcome to ChiPy's blog. We love contributors! This blog is [hosted on Github][chipy-gh]
using Github Pages and [Jekyll][jekyll]. You can fork it and make a pull request, or of
course talk to us at a [meetup][chipy-meetup].

There is an example post in the repo's *_drafts* directory with instructions on
how to contribute.
