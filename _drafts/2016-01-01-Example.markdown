Copy this post as a reference and move it to the `_posts` directory for a plain blog post, or the `python-shops/_posts` or `mentor-program/_posts`, depending on what the post is supposed to be.  Of course, the file needs a more appropriate title that matches the approximate date (it will be replaced by the `date` field at the top of the file). Finally, edit the contents and make a pull request to add it as a post to ChiPy's blog.
Be sure to change the tags -- keep both *mentor* and *"YYYY Q#"* if it's for the mentor program -- and set the permalink to what you'd like the permalink to be. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
    print("Hi", name)

print_hi('Tom')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
